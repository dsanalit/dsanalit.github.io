          <h2>About</h2>
<p> I graduated at the University of Catania, Catania (Italy) in 2017 in an M.Sc. degree in Automation Engineering and Control of Complex Systems. </p>
<p>In 2022, I completed my Ph.D. program in robotics at the National Institute for Applied Sciences, Toulouse, France and I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse, France in 2022.</p>
  <p> After serving as a non-Tenure Track Assistant Professor at the University of Catania (Italy), I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique (ISIR) at Sorbonne University.</p>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>Driven by the motto <em>“turning the unknown into the known,”</em> I am a roboticist interested in the modeling and control of dynamical systems, with a particular focus on multi-robot solutions. My overarching goal is to create robotic systems capable of engaging in <strong>physical interactions</strong> with their surroundings—exchanging forces to perform complex tasks that require intelligence, adaptability, and precision. This pursuit involves overcoming challenges in robot and environment modeling, control design, and system stability.</p>

        <p>With an M.Sc. in Automation Engineering, a Ph.D., two postdoctoral positions in Robotics, and a non-tenure track Assistant Professorship, my research has focused on <strong>object manipulation in physically interactive scenarios</strong>—including interactions between humans and robots, between multiple robots, and between robots and their environment.</p>

        <p>I have explored both <strong>theoretical and applied aspects</strong> of robotics, studying robot linear and nonlinear modeling, inverse kinematics control, robust control, shared control, indirect force control, barrier function–based control, and model predictive control. In recent years, I have also expanded my expertise into <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>, applying these tools to both modeling and control problems, as well as integrating them into my teaching activities.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, I aim to continue advancing the field of <strong>aerial robotics</strong>, focusing on intensifying the intelligence and coordination capabilities of <strong>multi-robot systems</strong> for complex physical interaction tasks.</p>
