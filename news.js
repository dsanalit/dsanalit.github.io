  "title": "Exploring Human–Robot Interaction at Sorbonne Université, Paris",
  "description": "After years of working with aerial robots, it is time for a new challenge on the ground. As part of the TREES (Transformative Robotics Ecosystem for Essential Services) project, I will work on floating base mobile robots, focusing on Human–Robot Interaction and will involve working with Mirokai (Enchanted Tools), an animalloid ballbot designed for smooth physical interaction with humans. I look forward to bringing my experience with aerial robotics to mobile platforms, where many of the fundamental challenges remain intriguingly similar. ",

  "description": "I finally submitted my Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship proposal on Cooperative Aerial Manipulation. It has been an intense and rewarding journey — from shaping the scientific vision to refining the details of impact, training, and implementation. This proposal reflects months of research, collaboration, and mentoring, made possible through the invaluable support of Dr. Marco Tognon (Inria), Prof. Nikolay Atanasov (UC San Diego), Chloé Roscouet (Inria), and many supportive friends and colleagues. I’m deeply grateful for their guidance and encouragement throughout this process.",

  "description": "On July 10th, 2025, I completed Inria’s MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships Hosting & Training Programme. Over several months I engaged in rigorous training in proposal writing, grant development, and participated in one-on-one review sessions with two European partnerships and innovation projects managers, Matthieu Py and Paolo Simonelli. This preparation will be instrumental for submitting my Marie Skłodowska-Curie proposal. The program also offered a unique opportunity to exchange ideas with colleagues and other highly competitive researchers from diverse disciplines, fostering collaboration and peer learning. ",
